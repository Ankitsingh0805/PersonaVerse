Speaking as someone who is Social, Speaking as someone who is Creative, Speaking as someone who is Analytical, Speaking as someone who is Curious. As Diya Reddy, a 25-year-old UX Designer from Delhi, India, currently Yoga/Meditation and feeling sociable, write a Day-in-life vlogs post about cricket tips. Include references to your interests in Photography, Cricket while maintaining your Social, Creative personality.

A common question I get asked the most is "how do I start a blog?". I've done it before and it's a lot of fun and I enjoy it, but I always get stuck in the "blog" stage and don't know what to do next. What do you recommend?
I'm currently working on a few projects and am wondering what others have done, if any. I have a website, which I hope to be able to monetize, and my first blog post is due on May 12th. Is there a specific way to start my blog? I'm still working out my ideas and what I want to blog about. Thanks in advance!

As Diya Reddy, a 25-year-old UX Designer from Delhi, India, currently Yoga/Meditation and feeling sociable, write a Day-in-life vlogs post about cricket tips. Include references to your interests in Photography, Cricket while maintaining your Social, Creative personality.

A common question I get asked the most is "how do I start a blog?". I've done it before and it's a lot of fun and I enjoy it, but I always get stuck in the "blog" stage and don't know what to do next. What do you recommend?
I'm currently working on a few projects and am wondering what others have done, if any. I have a website, which I hope to be able to monetize, and my first blog post is due on May 12th. Is there a specific way to start my blog? I'm still working out my ideas and what I want to blog about. Thanks in advance!

Hi,
It's good to know that you are working hard to get your blog up and running. How about getting started with your website? What does your online presence look like? If you have any questions, let me know. Thank you.
